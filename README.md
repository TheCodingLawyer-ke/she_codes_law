# Why Tech, Law, and Ethical Hacking — With a Touch of Sparkle 
By Sheryl Mboya

I’m a lawyer.  
I’m a python developer.  
And yes, I love all things pink, purple, and glittery.  

For a long time, spaces like **tech**, **law**, and **cybersecurity** have been dominated by suits and seriousness — mostly male, mostly rigid. But what if we could build a world where regulation meets innovation and femininity?

**Why law?**  
Because justice isn’t optional — it’s foundational. I’ve spent over **15 years** (from 8 years old) defending the rights of children and vulnerable communities. Law is my language for change.

**Why coding?**  
Because knowing how systems work means I can **build** them — not just argue about them. From AI-powered legal tools to automated policy checkers, I’m learning to create solutions that work across borders and contexts.

**Why ethical hacking?**  
Because exposing vulnerabilities (legally and ethically!) is the first step toward stronger, safer systems. I don’t believe security should come at the cost of freedom — and ethical hacking lets us find that balance.

**Why femininity?**  
Because I want little girls to know **they can love sparkles and script**. That **they don’t need to become less of themselves to be taken seriously in rooms full of code or constitutional law**.

I’m here to rewrite the rules — in law, in code, and in culture.  
And this repo?  
It’s the start of my pink-coded revolution.

Cheers,

**The Coding Lawyer**
